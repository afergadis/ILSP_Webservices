In the example package you will find two classes: `IlspNLP` and `Chunker`.

`IlspNLP` demonstrates how uses the service that detects paragraph sentence and token
boundaries and generates POS and lemma annotations for each token.

`Chucker` uses the same service as `IlspNLP` for the proprocess and the chunker 
service to recognize chunks in Greek texts.
